/**
 * Right-clicking opens the destination picker; the tooltip reports the trip currently being
 * navigated.
 *
 * <h2>This item exists on both sides</h2>
 * It is registered on a dedicated server as well as on a client, because a recipe is a data pack file
 * and data packs are read on both: a recipe naming an item the server has never heard of is a parse
 * error in its log, and in multiplayer the server owns the inventory, so an item only the client knew
 * about could not be crafted, held or dropped. The <em>behaviour</em> is still client-side, and the two
 * methods below are the whole of the seam -- each asks which side it is on before touching anything
 * that only exists on a client (see {@link NavigatorClient}).
