     * A line about how the mod is <em>working</em> rather than about what happened to the player: the
     * rail layer's one line a second, the cost of a map frame, what an MTR reading turned into, the
     * arithmetic of a planned route, the geometry of a line drawn as a straight step. All of it is
     * worth having while something is being investigated and none of it is worth writing once a second
     * for a whole session, so it goes through here and the switch is {@link RoadConfig#debugLog()}.
     *
     * <p>Everything that is not a diagnostic stays on the logger directly: warnings and errors, which
     * are always reported because a problem a player cannot see is a problem nobody can fix, and the
     * handful of one-off lines that say the mod loaded, saved or listened -- those are the record of a
     * session rather than measurements of it.
