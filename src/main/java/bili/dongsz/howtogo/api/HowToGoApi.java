/**
 * The way in.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for</h2>
 * Another mod has three things it may want from this one: to contribute a destination source, to ask
 * what this mod knows about the world, or to store a little data of its own beside the player's roads.
 * Each of those exists somewhere in this mod already, but behind classes that know which Minecraft and
 * which loader they are on and that are free to be reorganised between versions. This is the surface
 * that is not: it says what an addon may depend on, and everything it says is intended to keep
 * working.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing to declare, nothing to check in</h2>
 * There is no registration ceremony and no object to obtain: the methods are static and callable as
 * soon as the addon's own code runs, and the registries behind them are safe to write to from any
 * thread. An addon may register in its own constructor, or wait for
 * {@link HowToGoRegistrationEvent}, which is the mod's way of saying "everything is loaded, now is a
 * good moment" -- see that class for the difference.
 *
 * <h2>Client side only</h2>
 * This mod is a client mod: every method here is meaningful only where the game runs, and calling it
 * from a dedicated server would fail at class loading rather than answer anything. Addons should
 * declare the dependency with {@code side = "CLIENT"} and subscribe on {@code Dist.CLIENT}.
