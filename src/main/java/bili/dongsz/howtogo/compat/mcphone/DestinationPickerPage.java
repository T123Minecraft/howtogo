/**
 * Choosing a destination, drawn inside the phone.
 *
 * <h2>Shape of the screen</h2>
 * A map on top and a sheet along the bottom, the way a maps app does it: the sheet is a handle and
 * the current pick when collapsed, and the search box and the place list when expanded. A place can
 * be picked either by tapping the map or by tapping the list, and the footer button commits.
 *
 * <h2>There is no drag-panning, and that is the API's doing</h2>
 * {@code IPhonePage} publishes {@code mouseClicked}, {@code mouseScrolled}, {@code keyPressed} and
 * {@code charTyped} -- and no {@code mouseDragged} or {@code mouseReleased}. A page is therefore never
 * told that a button is being held, so dragging the map cannot be implemented here at all. What is
 * left is a tap to pick, the wheel to zoom, and the arrow keys to pan. That is a real limitation and
 * not a decision: if MCphone later publishes a drag callback, panning becomes a few lines.
 *
 * <h2>Coordinates</h2>
 * Everything is in absolute GUI coordinates, which is the only reading that holds together:
 * {@link PhoneCanvas#graphics()} is the game's own {@link GuiGraphics}, so drawing is absolute by
 * construction, and {@code canvas.x()/y()/width()/height()} say where the content area sits within
 * it. Hover is asked of {@link PhoneCanvas#hovered}, so the host owns that question.
 *
 * <h2>Size</h2>
 * No width or height is written down anywhere; every rectangle is derived from the canvas it is
 * given, and the sheet's height is a fraction of it, so a phone (120x200) and a tablet (226x158) both
 * get a usable map and a usable list.
 *
 * <h2>Drawing order</h2>
 * The map is emitted through one {@link HudDraw#consumer} and every quad of it goes out before any
 * string anywhere on the page: {@code drawString} flushes the buffer source, which ends the builder
 * behind that consumer, and one more quad through it throws {@code Not building!}. So {@link #drawMap}
 * runs first and only emits geometry; the sheet, its labels and the list follow it.
