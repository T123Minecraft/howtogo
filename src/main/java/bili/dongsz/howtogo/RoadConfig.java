     * have left the route every few hundred blocks is a navigation that fights the player. Too wide is
     * the cheaper mistake: the reading is a little vague about which road is underfoot, and the next
     * re-plan sorts it out.

     * <p>Water is the widest of all, deliberately: a boat is not tied to a line at all, and a canal is
