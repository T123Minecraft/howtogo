/**
 * Whether each line read out of MTR has its track marked as roads of this mod.
 *
 * <h2>What the switch does</h2>
 * A line read out of MTR has its stops, and MTR's rails are in the world under them. With a line's
 * marks on, the stretch of that track the line actually runs along is marked as read-only rail or water
 * roads -- drawn on the map like any other road, and the roads a ride along that line is planned over.
 * With them off, the line contributes no roads at all, and its stops are matched to the roads the
 * player drew by the ordinary rule this mod used before it knew anything about MTR, which is the right
 * answer for a line that runs on water or on roads that have already been drawn.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is per line and not one setting</h2>
 * The two kinds of line want opposite answers and the two answers coexist: a train line's track is its
 * own and is worth marking, while a boat line's water usually is not. A single switch would make the
 * player choose which of their lines to spoil.
 *
 * <h2>Why the choice is kept here rather than on the line</h2>
 * An imported line is rebuilt from MTR's reading every time the reading changes, so a field on it would
 * last until the next reading. What is kept instead is the player's answer, by MTR's own line id, which
 * is stable across readings and across sessions.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is kept for a line the player built: they are not MTR's, they take the configured default,
 * and a file full of ids of lines that no longer exist is not worth the trouble of writing. The answer
 * for a line that has never been touched is the configured default, so a player who never opens this
 * gets exactly what the config says.
