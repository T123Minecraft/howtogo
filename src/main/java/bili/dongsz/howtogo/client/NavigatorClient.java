/**
 * What the navigator item does when there is a client to do it on.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a class of its own</h2>
 * The item is registered on <b>both</b> sides, and it has to be: a recipe is a data pack file, data
 * packs are read on a dedicated server as well, and a recipe for an item the server has never heard of
 * is a parse error in its log -- worse, in multiplayer the server owns the inventory, so an item only
 * the client knows about cannot be crafted or held at all.
 *
 * <p>That puts {@code NavigatorItem} on the server, where it must not reach for anything that only
 * exists on a client: no {@code Minecraft}, no screens, no navigation readout. Those live here, and the
 * item calls in only after asking which side it is on -- the answer is asked of the level or of
 * {@link net.neoforged.fml.loading.FMLEnvironment}, never by assuming.
