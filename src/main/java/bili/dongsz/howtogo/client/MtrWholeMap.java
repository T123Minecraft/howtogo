/**
 * The whole railway, read out of the copy of it this process is already simulating.
 *
 * <h2>Why a second reading exists at all</h2>
 * MTR sends a client the stations and lines within a couple of hundred blocks of it, and that is the
 * whole of what {@link MtrClientData} can see on its own. The window is kept and added to as the player
 * travels -- see {@link MtrKnown} -- but a railway nobody has walked end to end is a railway this mod
 * only half knows, and the half it knows is decided by where the player happens to have been. Asking
 * MTR for a wider window instead is not an option: the radius is MTR's own constant, the answer carries
 * every rail of the network with it, and a client that asked for a thousand blocks would be sent a
 * payload it could not afford to receive.
 *
 * <h2>What is read, and from where</h2>
 * When the player hosts the world, MTR's server is a thread in this process and its network is a plain
 * object graph: {@code Simulator} per dimension, each holding every station, platform and route of that
 * dimension. That is the whole railway, in memory, with no network involved and nothing to serialize.
 * The chain is:
 * <pre>
 * org.mtr.Init (or org.mtr.mod.Init)   // whichever spelling this MTR uses
 *   .main                    (static)  // org.mtr.core.Main, set when the server started
 *     .simulators            (private) // one Simulator per dimension, matched by name
 *       .stations / .platforms / .routes
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Why every name above is looked up and never assumed</h2>
 * The same arrangement as {@link MtrClientData}, for the same reasons: MTR documents this as internal
 * working with no stable API, it is not installed on every copy of this mod, and 4.1 has already moved
 * its own classes once. So no MTR type appears in a signature, the {@code Main} field is recognised by
 * the type it holds rather than by its name, and anything that has moved simply reports itself
 * unavailable -- at which point the windowed reading above is what the mod offers, exactly as before.
 *
 * <h2>Why the read is taken on MTR's thread</h2>
 * The simulator mutates its sets on its own thread, and reading them from the render thread while it
 * ticks is how a client gets a torn reading or a concurrent-modification failure in a mod it merely
 * meant to look at. {@code Simulator.run} is MTR's own answer to that -- it queues a task for the
 * simulator's thread, which is what its HTTP servlets and its embedding mod both use -- so the whole
 * read happens there and only an immutable result is handed back. Nothing is ever written to MTR's
 * data.
