/**
 * The whole railway, read out of the copy MTR Map Overlay fetched from the server.
 *
 * <h2>Why this reading exists when the client's own does</h2>
 * MTR sends a client the stations and lines within a couple of hundred blocks of it. That window is
 * what {@link MtrClientData} reads and {@link MtrKnown} keeps, and on a server somebody else is
 * running there is nothing else to read: {@link MtrWholeMap} reaches the copy of the network this
 * process simulates, and on a remote server this process simulates none of it. So a railway the
 * player has not walked is a railway this mod does not know, and a journey to a station they have
 * never been near cannot be planned.
 *
 * <p>MTR Map Overlay answers exactly that. It asks the server -- which must have it installed too --
 * for a snapshot of every line, station and rail of MTR's network, and keeps it on the client. That
 * snapshot is the whole railway, on any server, and this class reads it.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is, and what is in it</h2>
 * <pre>
 * com.lx862.mtrmap.mapdata.MapDataCache
 *   .hasServerData(String dimension)     // static: is there a fetched snapshot for this dimension?
 *   .get(String dimension)               // static: the fetched snapshot, or the radius-limited one
 *     .dimensionId                       // "minecraft/overworld" -- MTR's own spelling
 *     .version                           // the snapshot's own content hash
 *     .routes                            // List&lt;MapRoute&gt;  -- every line
 *     .tracks                            // List&lt;MapTrack&gt;  -- every rail
 *     .landmarks                         // List&lt;MapLandmark&gt; -- every station, platform, depot
 * MapRoute    .id .name .color .stops    ; MapRoute.Stop  .x .z .stationName .destination
 * MapTrack    .id .points (List&lt;double[]{x, z}&gt;)
 * MapLandmark .id() .type() .x() .y() .z() .name() .symbol()      // a record
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Only the fetched snapshot, never the fallback</h2>
 * With the mod installed on the client alone, or on a server that does not have it, that cache holds
 * MTR's own radius-limited data -- the very window {@link MtrClientData} already reads. Reading it
 * here as well would offer the same stations twice, through two readers that could disagree. So the
 * snapshot is only read when {@code hasServerData} says the server answered, and nothing at all is
 * read otherwise.
 *
 * <h2>Why the reading is cached</h2>
 * A whole railway is a lot of geometry: every rail of it arrives as a list of points that has to be
 * copied into this mod's own arrays. So the conversion is done once per snapshot -- keyed by the
 * snapshot's own content hash, which changes only when the server's railway does -- and every tick
 * between those changes reads the same reading.
 *
 * <h2>Why the rails are taken whole, and why that is not a cost</h2>
 * An earlier version of this class took only the rails within a radius of the player, because the
 * rails are what a line's marks are cut from and cutting them meant planning a ride between every
 * pair of neighbouring stops over the whole network. That is no longer what happens, and the radius
 * was actively harmful: it left most of the railway without geometry, so a line whose rails it had
 * taken away was drawn as straight hops between its stations -- which is the one thing the fetched
 * snapshot exists to fix. See {@link MtrMapOverlay} on {@code MapRoute.trackIds} and
 * {@code MtrLineTracks.stated}: the snapshot says which rails each route runs along, so a line's
 * track is a lookup rather than a plan, and there is nothing left for a radius to bound.
 *
 * <h2>What the snapshot does not say</h2>
 * Two things, and both are answered from what it does say rather than guessed at:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the lines' kind</b> -- there is no transport mode anywhere in it. It does not need one:
 *       the overlay samples a rail only when its transport mode is {@code TRAIN}, so a snapshot's
 *       track is train track, and a route whose track could not be sampled is left out of it
 *       entirely. What arrives is therefore the train network, and that is what it is read as. A boat
 *       line is reached the way it always was: through MTR's own client data, whose stations carry a
 *       mode.</li>
 *   <li><b>the rails' height</b> -- the geometry is sampled into X and Z alone, so a rail stands at
 *       the height of the nearest station or platform of the snapshot, and at
 *       {@link #FALLBACK_TRACK_Y} where there is none near. It is a hint and is documented as one:
 *       {@link MtrClientData#merge} lets MTR's own copy of a rail -- which carries its real height --
 *       win over this one wherever MTR has sent it, so only a rail MTR never sent stands on the
 *       hint.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why nothing here is a dependency</h2>
 * The same arrangement {@link MtrClientData} and {@link MtrWholeMap} use, for the same reasons: the
 * mod is not installed on every copy of this one, it documents no API of its own for this, and its
 * shape is free to move. So no type of it appears in a signature, every handle is looked up by name
 * once and guarded, and a version whose shapes have moved reports itself unavailable -- at which
 * point the windowed reading above is what the mod offers, exactly as before.
