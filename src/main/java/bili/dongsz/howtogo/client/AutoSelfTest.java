/**
 * Runs the in-game self-test by itself, for a launcher that asked for it.
 *
 * <h2>Why a launcher switch and not only the command</h2>
 * {@code /howtogo selftest} is how a player checks their own world. A test rig needs to check a world
 * without anybody typing: it starts the client, the client loads a world by itself (Minecraft's own
 * {@code --quickPlaySingleplayer} argument), and the report has to land in the log for the rig to read
 * and grade. That is what this is, and {@code tools/user-test/run-user-test.ps1 -Auto} is the rig that
 * sets it up.
 *
 * <h2>What it will not do</h2>
 * Nothing at all unless the property is set, and then exactly once per run: a switch that ran the
 * self-test in an ordinary session would move the player's destination and switch their travel mode
 * without being asked. It waits for a world to be loaded, because every check is about the world and
 * half of them need the player standing in it.
