/**
 * Where this mod's per-world data files live.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class</h2>
 * Two things are stored per world and dimension now -- the road network and the names of the
 * automatically detected rail layer -- and they have to agree on which world and which dimension
 * they are talking about, or a name saved in one dimension would be looked up in another. One
 * resolver, used by both, is the only way that cannot drift apart; two copies of the same four lines
 * would agree today and disagree after the next edit to either.
 *
 * <h2>Why the config directory</h2>
 * Not the save folder: on a multiplayer server the client has no access to the save at all. The
 * dimension is part of the file name because coordinates are only meaningful within one dimension.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is public</h2>
 * Because an addon storing a little of its own data has exactly the same problem, and the same
 * answer: per world, per dimension, beside the roads rather than in a directory it invented. It gets
 * there through {@code HowToGoApi.dataFile(suffix)}, which is the documented way in; this class is
 * public only so that entry point does not have to be a second copy of these four lines.
