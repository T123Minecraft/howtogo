/**
 * What the map draws, and what it leaves out.
 *
 * <h2>Two kinds of leaving out, and why both</h2>
 * The first is the player's own: a switch per kind of road, for the public transport lines, and per kind
 * of place, set from the panel on the map and kept in a file. That is for taste -- a player who never
 * wants footpaths drawn, or who is done with the shops they marked last month.
 *
 * <p>The second is by zoom, and it is not taste but arithmetic: at a scale where a whole region fits on
 * the screen, drawing every path and every market stall turns the map into a smear, and what the player
 * wants at that scale is the shape of the network. So detail is shed as the map is zoomed out, in an
 * order that keeps the things a map is read for: the highways and the ice roads are never shed at all,
 * then the paths go, then the ordinary roads, then the waterways, then the railways; on the places, the
 * shops go first, then the stations, then ordinary landmarks, and the resource points -- the ones worth
 * travelling to from far away -- last. The public transport lines are never shed: they are the mod's own
 * subject, and a line is the one thing on the map that is not already implied by the roads.
 *
 * <p>Both kinds are asked through this class, so the panel's switches and the zoom rules cannot drift
 * apart: {@link #shows(RoadClass, double)} is the whole question, and the answer is "the player has not
 * hidden it, and the map is not too far out to draw it".
