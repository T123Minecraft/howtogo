/**
 * Create's train tracks, read out of the loaded chunks as a read-only rail layer.
 *
 * <h2>Blocks, not classes</h2>
 * A track is recognised by the block in the world -- by its registry name, {@code create:track} by
 * default -- and by nothing else. No Create class is ever loaded, so a player without Create simply
 * has an empty layer, a Create release that renames a class cannot break anything, and there is no
 * dependency in {@code build.gradle} and none in the mod metadata. The names are configuration
 * rather than constants, so a renamed or add-on block can be followed without a new build.
 *
 * <h2>The shape of the layer, and why a track's own shape decides the joins</h2>
 * A track block is not a crossroads of four directions: it carries tracks along one or two
 * <em>axes</em>, and an axis can run diagonally. A straight piece is {@code zo} or {@code xo}; a
 * 45-degree piece is {@code pd} or {@code nd}, whose axis is a corner-to-corner diagonal; a slope is
 * {@code an}, {@code as}, {@code ae} or {@code aw}, whose axis carries its own one-block rise; a
 * curve or a crossing is one of the {@code cr_} shapes, which carry two axes and therefore connect
 * in four places.
 *
 * <p>So a block is joined to the block at each end of each of its own axes, and the other block has
 * to reach back along the same axis for the join to exist. Joining every side neighbour instead
 * would be wrong twice over: a diagonal piece of track -- which is how Create builds every bend --
 * would be a row of isolated blocks with no line at all, and two tracks laid touching side by side
 * would be welded into one. The axes are read from the block state's own {@code shape} property, by
 * name, so this is still nothing but data: the property is a plain enum implementing Minecraft's
 * {@link StringRepresentable}, and the table below is Create's own {@code TrackShape} axes. A shape
 * this table does not know is treated as reaching in every direction around it rather than as
 * reaching nowhere, so a shape added by a later release or by an add-on can make the layer clumsier
 * but cannot make a line disappear.
 *
 * <p>Blocks are then compressed: track blocks are the graph, and a run of track between two
 * junctions becomes one polyline. A thousand-block line is a handful of segments, and a bend inside
 * one of those runs is kept as a vertex of it. The result is a plain {@link RoadNetwork} of
 * {@link RoadClass#RAIL} segments, so the router, the map and the class colours all treat it exactly
 * as they treat a hand-drawn rail: there is no second kind of road anywhere downstream.
 *
 * <h2>Two sources, one layer</h2>
 * The layer is built from <b>Create's own client-side track graph</b> when it can be read, and from a
 * scan of track blocks when it cannot. The graph is preferred because it is the data Create itself
 * draws on the map: its node positions are Create's, a curve arrives as a real Bezier rather than as
 * a staircase of blocks, and a station carries the name the player gave it. The block scan stays as
 * the fallback for a client without Create, a Create that renamed something, or a graph that has not
 * been sent -- and it is the reason this feature works at all if the reflection ever breaks.
 *
 * <p>Only one of the two is ever the layer, so no track can be counted twice: while the graph answers,
 * the scan is not run and whatever it had remembered is dropped. Both sources produce the same thing
 * -- a graph of nodes and edges, compressed into one polyline per run of track between two junctions
 * -- so everything downstream cannot tell which one built it.
 *
 * <h2>Read-only, and never saved</h2>
 * The layer lives here and in no other place. It is never handed to {@link RoadStore}, so the editor
 * -- which is built over that network -- cannot see it, and it is never passed to storage, so
 * nothing about it reaches {@code config/howtogo/...}. Routing does not merge into the saved network
 * either: {@link #forRouting} returns a copy with the layer folded in, and returns the saved network
 * itself when the layer cannot take part at all, which is what makes "walking and driving routes are
 * untouched" true by construction rather than by inspection. Create's graph is only ever read.
 *
 * <h2>Cost</h2>
 * Reading the world is new ground for this mod, so the budget is explicit. The layer works in
 * <b>one batch a second</b>, on the client tick and never on the render thread: between batches
 * nothing runs but a counter, and when the counter comes round the layer does one second's work and
 * stops. From Create's graph that work is a walk of the graph itself -- no chunk is read at all, and
 * the graph is only re-read when Create's own change counter moves or every fifth second as a safety
 * net. From the block scan it is {@code create_track_chunks_per_second} chunks read in one go, taken
 * nearest-first from a queue filled as rings around the player out to
 * {@code create_track_scan_radius}; a chunk's sections are tested through their palettes and only a
 * section whose palette holds a track is walked block by block, so a chunk with no track costs a few
 * dozen palette tests. A scanned chunk is remembered once read and not read again for a whole sweep,
 * and the chunk the player stands in is read every second regardless, so track laid underfoot shows
 * up at once rather than at the next pass over the map.

     * graph it is planned on. Nothing about its routes can change, and that is a property of this

     * survives the next change to those filters.
     *
     * <p>Which classes a <em>trip</em> avoids is not asked here. The layers are merged or not by what
     * the mode can move on, and a ride over them is then restricted by that line's own policy -- see
     * {@link bili.dongsz.howtogo.route.LinePlanner#ridePreferences}, which ignores the player's
     * avoidances on purpose so that a line the player declared a railway is still a railway. A layer
     * this method declined to merge because of a global avoidance could not be put back by that
     * policy, so the two would disagree about the same journey.
     *
     * <h2>Why the merge is a copy</h2>
     * The saved network is not touched, and neither is any layer: the router splits segments while
     * anchoring, so it needs something it may mutate, and it gets copies of all of them. The layers are
     * therefore read-only in the strong sense -- nothing downstream holds a reference it could write
     * through -- and neither is ever saved with the player's roads.
     *
     * <h2>What is merged</h2>
     * Two layers, and both are readings of the world rather than drawings of the player's: this class's
     * Create rails, and {@link MtrTransit}'s rails read out of MTR. They are merged in one place
     * because this is the one place that answers "what does a plan run on", and an answer assembled

     * curve from the points of {@code BezierConnection.rasterise()}. Nothing in it decides that two
     * edges form one road, and nothing in it can therefore invent a line between two edges that do not
     * meet. An earlier version here walked runs of edges through pass-through nodes and stitched them
     * into one polyline, and every bug that produced phantom geometry came from that stitching: each
     * edge's geometry had to be assumed to start where the previous one ended. Taking the edges one at
     * a time removes the assumption instead of guarding it -- there is no order beyond an edge's own
     * two ends, and no vertex can come from any edge but its own.
     *
     * <p>Segments still meet, because the edges that meet at a node are given that node's coordinates
     * (the ends of each polyline are the node positions): meeting is a consequence of shared
     * coordinates, not of joining.
     *
     * <p>The cost is one segment per edge instead of one per run -- twelve instead of four in the case
     * that prompted this -- which is nothing for a graph of this size, and a segment per edge is
     * exactly what a hand-drawn road already is. The router, the map and the class colours see the
     * same kind of network either way, and {@code RoadChains} still gathers a run of edges into one

     * {@code RoadChains} is the right tool for the saved network, which is a few hundred segments
     * and is walked a handful of times. It cannot be the tool for this step: it finds the segment
     * continuing through a node by scanning every segment of the network, which over a graph of tens
     * of thousands of edges is quadratic, and this runs on a client tick. So the compression is done
     * here, in one pass over an adjacency table built once, and the result is a plain
     * {@link RoadNetwork}: from that point on -- the router's degree counts, its graph, the map --
     * everything downstream is the same code that already handles a hand-drawn rail, whichever source
     * the geometry came from.
     *
     * <p>Nodes are only created at junctions and ends, and shared between every run that meets at
     * them, so a fork is one node rather than three stacked on one point. Ends and junctions are
     * walked first, so every run comes out whole; walking from the middle of one would split it in two.
