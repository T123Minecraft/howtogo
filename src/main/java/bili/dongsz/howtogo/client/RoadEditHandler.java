/**
 * Mouse and keyboard control for the road editor.
 *
 * <h2>Why the keys come through the screen event and the mouse does not</h2>
 * The two input paths are not symmetric in this NeoForge build, and the asymmetry is the whole
 * reason the editor's keys stopped working while its mouse kept going. Read out of the patched
 * sources:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code KeyboardHandler.keyPress} offers the key to the open screen <b>first</b>
 *       ({@code onScreenKeyPressedPre}, then {@code screen.keyPressed}) and returns right there if the
 *       screen took it, posting {@code InputEvent.Key} only afterwards. Xaero's map consumes the keys
 *       it uses, so an {@code InputEvent.Key} listener never sees them: the R press was being eaten by
 *       the map screen before NeoForge's key event existed at all, which no gate could fix.</li>
 *   <li>{@code MouseHandler.onPress} posts {@code InputEvent.MouseButton} <b>before</b> any screen
 *       dispatch, so clicks arrive whether the screen wants them or not. That is why editing by mouse
 *       always worked.</li>
 * </ul>
 * So keys are handled from {@link ScreenEvent.KeyPressed.Pre} and {@link ScreenEvent.KeyReleased.Pre},
 * which fire before the screen sees the key and are indifferent to whether it would consume it, and
 * the key is cancelled only when the editor actually uses it -- otherwise Xaero would lose its own
 * shortcuts. There is deliberately no {@code InputEvent.Key} listener beside these: a key the map
 * happens not to consume would then be handled twice, and R would toggle on and off again.
 *
 * <h2>Controls</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>R</b> - toggle road editing (also rebindable under Controls)</li>
 *   <li><b>Left click</b> - place a point, extending the road being drawn</li>
 *   <li><b>Alt + left click</b> - place a point exactly where the cursor is, snapping disabled</li>
 *   <li><b>Shift + left click / drag</b> - grab and move a node, or select a road</li>
 *   <li><b>Ctrl + left click</b> - set the current cursor spot as the navigation destination
 *       (works whether or not editing is on). This is the only way to start navigating from the map;
 *       there used to be a bare {@code G} as well, and it was dropped because a single unmodified
 *       letter on the map is too easy to press by accident and the map already owns most of them.</li>
 *   <li><b>Right click</b> - finish the current road, or clear the selection</li>
 *   <li><b>&lt; / &gt;</b> (comma / period) - change the road class being drawn, or of the selection</li>
 *   <li><b>N</b> - name the selected road, or the road under the cursor</li>
 *   <li><b>O</b> - make the selected road, or the road under the cursor, one-way; each press moves it
 *       on to the next state, and the fourth brings it back to two-way</li>
 *   <li><b>Delete</b> - delete the selection</li>
 *   <li><b>Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y</b> - undo / redo</li>
 * </ul>
