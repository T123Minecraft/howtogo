/**
 * Everything this mod does, checked against the world the player actually has open.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists inside the game</h2>
 * The routing harness in {@code tools/} covers the pure logic on networks built for the purpose, and
 * that is where a rule belongs. What it cannot cover is the part a player meets: whether the roads they
 * drew are the roads the mod loaded, whether a line they configured can carry a journey across the
 * world as it stands, whether the guidance says something a person could follow, and whether anything
 * at all survives a save and a reload. Those questions have no answer outside a running client with
 * real data in it -- so this runs there, is asked for by a command, and reports what it found.
 *
 * <h2>What it is allowed to do</h2>
 * Read, and put back. It plans routes and journeys (which are pure calculations), judges the
 * connectivity of every line (also a calculation), and round-trips the network through a temporary file
 * rather than the player's. The one thing it changes is the live navigation: a simulated ride is driven
 * through the real {@link Navigation} guidance, which means setting a destination and putting back
 * whatever was being navigated before. That is why the command that runs this says so.
 *
 * <h2>What a failure means</h2>
 * A check fails when the mod could not do something it says it can do with data that is there -- a
 * journey the lines describe but the planner cannot carry, a save that does not read back as what was
 * written, a guidance sequence with a stage missing. A line the player has left broken, or an empty
 * world, is reported as a finding rather than as a failure: those are answers about their data, not
 * about this mod.

     * covered outside. What it cannot cover is the two things that depend on how the game is
     * launched: whether {@code com.sun.net.httpserver} is resolvable from a mod at all -- it needs the
     * JDK's own module, and a launcher that built a narrower module graph would leave the page dead
     * with nothing but a {@code NoClassDefFoundError} in the log -- and whether the page, its scripts
     * and the vendored html2canvas are found through the mod's own class loader, which is a
     * transforming one in development and a jar in a release.
     *
     * <p>It is checked on a port the operating system hands out, on the loopback address, and the
     * server is stopped before this returns, so a self-test never leaves a listening socket behind and
     * never collides with a map the player has open.
     *
     * <h2>Why it does not go through the main-thread hand-off</h2>
     * This runs <em>on</em> the client thread, and the real API reads the roads by queueing work for
     * exactly that thread and waiting for it -- so asking it here would be the client thread waiting
     * for itself, and the check would hang until the timeout and then fail for the wrong reason. The
     * snapshot is therefore taken here, where the network is, and handed to the server as a finished
     * reading; that is a copy by construction, so nothing on the HTTP thread can touch the live roads.
