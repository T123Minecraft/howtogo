/**
 * Destinations from Xaero's own waypoints, read reflectively out of the Minimap mod.
 *
 * <h2>Why the reading is reflective</h2>
 * Waypoint storage is <b>not</b> part of Xaero's World Map: neither the World Map jar nor the
 * {@code xaerolib} it bundles has a single class under {@code waypoints/}. The storage, and every
 * class needed to reach it, lives in the Minimap mod ({@code xaero.common.minimap.waypoints.*}),
 * which is only an <em>optional</em> dependency of the World Map and may not be installed at all.
 *
 * <p>The adapter is therefore bound by name at runtime rather than against the jar, so this mod
 * keeps compiling and running with the Minimap absent and does not gain a dependency on it in
 * {@code build.gradle}. When the Minimap is present the chain is walked once and the handles are
 * cached; when it is absent, or when the mod has renamed anything, the source reports itself
 * unavailable and the picker falls back to {@link PoiDestinationSource}.
 *
 * <p>The chain, verified against {@code xaerominimap-neoforge-1.21.1-25.3.13.jar}:
 * <pre>
 * XaeroMinimapSession.getCurrentSession()   // static, null before a world is joined
 *   .getWaypointsManager()
 *   .getCurrentWorld()                      // WaypointWorld, null outside a world
 *   .getCurrentSet()
 *   .getList()                              // ArrayList&lt;Waypoint&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each waypoint then answers {@code getName()}, {@code getX()}, {@code getZ()},
 * {@code isTemporary()} -- temporary ones are skipped, since a death marker or a just-dropped pin is
 * not a place to navigate to -- and its colour through {@code getWaypointColor().getHex()}. The name
 * is handed on exactly as Xaero stores it: the picker's "(From XMM)" note is a row decoration drawn
 * from the destination's source id, never part of the name, so the route instructions, the spoken
 * announcements and the search all still see the bare name.

     * <h2>Which getter, and why not {@code getColor()}</h2>
     * The Minimap has three colour getters and only one of them is a colour. Read out of its
     * bytecode:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code getColor()} returns <b>the enum ordinal</b>, not a colour at all -- it is
     *       {@code getWaypointColor().ordinal()}, used as the index the GUI lists colours by;</li>
     *   <li>{@code getActualColor()} returns a field of the same kind, set from that same ordinal
     *       (the {@code int} constructor writes its index argument straight into it);</li>
     *   <li>{@code getWaypointColor().getHex()} is the colour, and is what the Minimap's own
     *       renderer draws with -- {@code WaypointMapRenderer.renderElement} calls it and then
     *       extracts channels as {@code (hex >> 16) & 0xFF} for red.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>Format</h2>
     * The enum constants are standard Minecraft text colours packed as <b>ARGB with full alpha</b>:
     * BLACK is {@code -16777216} = {@code 0xFF000000}, DARK_AQUA {@code -16733526} = {@code 0xFF00AAAA},
     * DARK_RED {@code -5636096} = {@code 0xFFAA0000}, and so on. They are converted defensively
     * anyway -- masked to the low 24 bits and given full alpha -- so a future release that packs
     * them without alpha, or with a different one, still yields a visible colour instead of an
     * invisible one. A colour that comes back as bare {@code 0} is treated as none, which also keeps
     * this from ever storing the sentinel by accident.
