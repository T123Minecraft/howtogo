/**
 * Spoken navigation announcements, through the text-to-speech engine Minecraft ships with.
 *
 * <p>The engine directly rather than vanilla's {@code GameNarrator}: that wrapper gates every phrase
 * on the player's own narrator setting and throws the phrase away when it is off, so announcements
 * would depend on a second switch the player never connected to this mod. This mod's own toggle is
 * therefore the only switch, and the speech is what the player asked for either way.
 *
 * <h2>Why the state is explicit</h2>
 * The navigation readout is recomputed every frame, so a turn instruction "changes" twenty times a
 * second as its distance ticks down -- and the spoken line carries that distance, so its text is no
 * guide at all. What is spoken is instead driven from the client tick and remembered per manoeuvre:
 * the approach line fires once as the junction comes within the lead distance for the pace being
 * made, the "now" line fires once at the junction, and nothing repeats in between.
 *
 * <p>A silent client is still possible -- the speech library is a native one and can fail to load --
 * but that is a fault rather than a setting, so it is reported once in the log and stated in the
 * readout instead of being left as unexplained silence.
 *
 * <h2>Why the opening line is left alone, and nothing else is</h2>
 * Guidance supersedes guidance: a turn prompt that arrives after the turn is noise, so the newest
 * phrase replaces whatever is waiting and the engine is told to purge whatever is being said. The
 * trip's opening line is the one phrase that is not guidance and never goes out of date, so for about
 * as long as it takes to say, nothing else is announced at all -- neither handed over nor allowed to
 * set the latches that decide what has been announced. That is what makes the road notice and the
 * first junction follow it rather than talk over it, which is what they were doing: the engine says a
 * phrase without waiting for it, and the next phrase purges it, so a line handed over one tick later
 * cuts the opening words off mid-word and the two are heard as one sentence. See
 * {@link #spokenTicks} for why "as long as it takes" has to be estimated rather than asked for.
 *
 * <h2>Why the speaking happens on another thread</h2>
 * The engine is a native one whose {@code clear()} and {@code say()} block until it has finished:
 * measured in play, a single call held the client thread for up to half a second. That is the stutter
 * the player sees at junctions, because junctions are exactly when a phrase is spoken. So the client
 * tick only ever hands a phrase over -- a string assignment under a lock nobody holds for longer than
 * it takes to read a field -- and one dedicated thread owns the engine and does the blocking work.
 *
 * <p>What crosses between the two threads is deliberately tiny and is listed on the fields below.
 * Everything else here -- the latch, the trip state, the readout's "no engine" flag -- is touched by
 * the client thread alone, which is also the thread that renders, so it needs no synchronisation.
 *
 * <h2>Why an English announcement can be read with Chinese numbers</h2>
 * Reported in play: with the game in English, "In 49 m, turn right onto unnamed road" was heard with
 * the number and the unit in Chinese -- "四十九米". The text is not the cause: on an English client
 * the whole sentence is English ASCII, because every part of it comes from {@code en_us.json} together
 * with {@link Route#formatDistance}, which writes the number as digits and takes the rest of its
 * wording from the same language files. The engine is the cause, and it has exactly one voice:
 * {@code Narrator.getNarrator()} creates the SAPI voice object through
 * {@code CoCreateInstance(CLSID_SpVoice)}, which is whatever Windows has as its default, and the
 * library exposes no way to ask for another one -- its whole API is say, clear, active, destroy and
 * getNarrator. A Chinese default voice reads the English words as English but the digits by its own
 * language's rules, which is where "49 m" becomes 四十九米.
 *
 * <p>So the cure is outside the mod: set a different default voice for Windows (Settings &gt; Time
 * &amp; Language &gt; Speech &gt; Voice), which is what every SAPI caller on the machine hears, vanilla
 * narration included. Writing the number as words would not help either: the digits are the half the
 * voice gets wrong, and it would still be the same voice reading them.

     * {@code active} and {@code destroy}; on Windows {@code say} hands the text to the SAPI voice with
     * {@code SPF_ASYNC} and returns without waiting, and the only thing that says a phrase is over is

     * allow it the time, and the time has to come from the text.
     *
     * <h2>The text is all there is to go on</h2>
     * A phrase's length is the only thing about it that says anything, and it says different things in
     * different scripts: a Han character is a syllable, a Latin one is a fraction of a word. So the
     * count is per script -- Han, kana and Hangul counted as syllables, everything else as letters --
     * and the two are priced differently. Digits are counted with the letters, which is neither right
     * nor badly wrong: they are read as words, and the voice doing it has a language of its own that
     * this mod cannot see. See the class comment.
     *
     * <p>A floor and a ceiling, because the estimate is used to hold other announcements back: too
     * short and the phrase it is protecting still gets cut, too long and the guidance arrives late for
     * no reason. The floor is also what gives the next phrase its pause, which is what "one after the
     * other" has to sound like rather than two sentences run together.
     *
     * <p>Package-private rather than private so that the harness can check it: this is the only part
     * of the hold that is a decision rather than a clock, and getting it wrong is not visible in the
