     *
     * <p>A line read out of MTR is drawn along the track it runs on, which is known and is not a question
     * about anybody's roads -- and is drawn that way whether or not the line's marks are switched on. The
     * switch decides whether that track is also added to the road network as rail or water roads; it has
     * nothing to do with where the line is drawn. Planning an imported line over the roads instead, which
     * is what this used to do, is what made a line switched off collapse into straight hops between its
     * stops and read as having gone missing.
     *
     * <p>An imported line whose track is not known is therefore drawn as nothing at all: its stations are
     * still marked, and a straight hop from one to the next would be a claim about ground the line may not
     * cross. It is the same answer {@link TrackRuns} gives to a gap inside a track that is partly known,
     * taken to its end -- the map shows the track it has and invents none. Such a line is not lost: a
     * window that brings its rails is a window that draws it, and until then its stops are on the map.
     *
     * <p>A line of the player's own has no track of its own, so what is drawn is the route the mod
     * plans between each neighbouring pair of its stops -- and a pair that cannot be planned is left as
     * a gap rather than drawn as a straight hop, which is the same rule an imported line follows and
     * the same reason. It used to be drawn as a hop, so that a mis-typed line was visible as a line
     * rather than as a gap; on a world with a city's worth of lines that produced a web of straight
     * lines across the whole map, each one claiming ground the line does not run over, and the real
     * lines lost in it. A gap says what is true: the path is not known here. Every stop of every line
     * is still marked, below, so a line whose path cannot be worked out at all is not a line nobody can
     * find.
