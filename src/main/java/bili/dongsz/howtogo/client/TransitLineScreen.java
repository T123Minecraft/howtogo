/**
 * The line editor: build the public transport lines of this dimension and say which stops each one
 * calls at, in order.
 *
 * <h2>Three columns, one screen</h2>
 * Lines on the left, the stops of the selected line in the middle, and every stop that could be
 * added on the right. The alternative -- a screen per line, or a dialog per stop -- would make
 * building a six-stop line a dozen screen transitions, and the whole point of the thing is to let a
 * player describe a route in the order they remember it. Everything a line needs is therefore on one
 * screen at once.
 *
 * <h2>What the right-hand column offers</h2>
 * Every stop in the world, from both of its sources. A stop the player marked as a station is
 * editable and may later be renamed or retyped through the place editor; a station Create's track
 * graph reports can be used by a line but not renamed or retyped here, because its name and its type
 * belong to Create and editing either would leave the line describing a station that is not the one
 * standing in the world. Those rows say so.
 *
 * <h2>Which stops a line is offered</h2>
 * The stations Create reports are rail stations, so they are offered to rail lines only. Marked
 * places are offered to every kind, because the player put them where they meant to and nothing in
 * the data says which class of road they stand on.
