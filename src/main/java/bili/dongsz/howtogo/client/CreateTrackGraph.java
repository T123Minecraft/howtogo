/**
 * Create's client-side track graph, read reflectively.
 *
 * <h2>Why this and not the blocks</h2>
 * Create puts the whole rail network on the client: {@code GlobalRailwayManager.trackNetworks} holds
 * the {@code TrackGraph}s, and Create's own map integration draws them. Reading that is better than
 * reading blocks for three reasons: the node positions are Create's own, so a track is where Create
 * says it is rather than at a block centre; a curve is one edge with a real Bezier on it, which can
 * be sampled, rather than a staircase of diagonal blocks; and a station carries its name, which the
 * blocks never do. Nothing here needs a dependency: no Create class appears in a signature, every
 * handle is looked up by name once and guarded, and with Create absent this reports itself
 * unavailable and the caller falls back to its own block scan.
 *
 * <h2>The chain, taken from Create's own integration</h2>
 * Create's {@code XaeroFullscreenMapMixin} hands off to {@code XaeroTrainMap.onRender}, which goes
 * through {@code TrainMapManager}. Its bytecode reads exactly this, and so does this class:
 * <pre>
 * CreateClient.RAILWAYS                     // static, the client's own manager
 *   .trackNetworks                          // Map&lt;UUID, TrackGraph&gt; -- one per connected network
 *     .getNodes()                           // Set&lt;TrackNodeLocation&gt;
 *     .locateNode(TrackNodeLocation)        // TrackNode
 *     .getConnectionsFrom(TrackNode)        // Map&lt;TrackNode, TrackEdge&gt;
 *     .getPoints(EdgePointType.STATION)     // Collection&lt;GlobalStation&gt;
 * TrackNode.getLocation().getLocation()     // Vec3, the node's world position
 * TrackEdge.isTurn() / getLength() / getPosition(TrackGraph, double)
 * GlobalStation.blockEntityPos / name
 * </pre>
 * The manager also reads {@code version}, a counter it bumps when the network changes, which is used
 * here to avoid rebuilding a layer that cannot have changed.
