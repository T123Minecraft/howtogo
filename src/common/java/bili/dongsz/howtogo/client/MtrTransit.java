/**
 * What {@link MtrClientData} read, said in this mod's own terms.
 *
 * <h2>Three things come out of it</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>stops</b> -- one per station of the network, for the destination and stop pickers to offer
 *       beside the player's own places and the stations Create reports. Read-only by construction,
 *       exactly as a Create station is: {@link LineStop#ofStation} carries no node id, so there is
 *       nothing here the player could rename or retype by accident. A station of MTR's is not
 *       necessarily one entry: MTR makes a station of every area the player draws, so the platforms of
 *       one station commonly arrive as several stations, and they are offered as the one place they are
 *       -- see {@link #places};</li>
 *   <li><b>lines</b> -- one per MTR route whose type this mod has a kind for, with the stops the client
 *       currently knows about. They are handed to the planner and never to the line editor, which is
 *       what makes them read-only: the editor works on the player's own list and this is a different
 *       list, so no accident in the editor can write to a line MTR owns;</li>
 *   <li><b>the track they run along</b> -- for each line whose marks are switched on, the stretch
 *       between its own neighbouring stops, stamped as read-only rail or water roads of this mod. Not
 *       MTR's rails as a whole: MTR's data does not say which rails belong to which line, so each line's
 *       ride is planned over them and the path it takes is what is marked. A line whose marks are off
 *       contributes nothing, and its stops are then matched to the roads the player drew.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why the stops are where the platforms are</h2>
 * A station's centre is the centre of its whole area, which for a large station is nowhere near the
 * track; the platforms are where vehicles stop. A line's stop is therefore placed at the middle of the
 * station's platforms, and a station with no platform in range falls back to the centre of its area --
 * see {@link MtrClientData.Snapshot#stopPosition}. A place made of several of MTR's stations stands at
 * the middle of all their platforms, which is the same rule over a wider set.
 *
 * <h2>Why a line may be short</h2>
 * MTR sends a client what is near it, so the stops of a long line arrive a window at a time: what is
 * offered here is the part of the line around the player, which is also the part they could actually
 * board -- unless the whole railway can be read instead, which is what {@link MtrWholeMap} does whenever
 * the player is the one hosting the world, and what {@link MtrMapOverlay} does on any server whose
 * server half has fetched it. A line is not padded out to look complete, a stop whose station the
 * client has not been sent is left out rather than placed wrongly and counted, and a line left with
 * fewer than two placed stops is not offered at all -- a line with no ride in it would only ever
 * answer "no journey".
 *
 * <h2>Where the conversion runs, and what that costs the caller</h2>
 * On a worker of its own, not on the thread that asks -- see {@link #WORKER}. The accessors below
 * therefore offer the newest reading that has finished being worked out rather than one built on the
 * spot, so a caller can be answered with the reading before the current one: that is the price of a
 * whole railway's worth of lines never being converted in the middle of a frame, and it is the same
 * bargain {@link MtrWholeMap} already makes for the network it reads. {@link #warmUp()} is what keeps
 * the window between the two small, by starting the work when the reading changes rather than when
 * something first wants it.

     * <h2>Why the conversion is not done where it is asked for</h2>
     * It used to be, guarded by a signature so that it ran once per reading rather than once per call.
     * That was enough while a reading was a couple of lines around the player: marking a line plans one
     * ride per pair of its neighbouring stops, and a couple of lines is a couple of rides. A reading of
     * a whole railway is hundreds of lines over a rail layer that a fetched snapshot can make thousands
     * of segments long, and the first thing to ask for it in a session is a map being drawn -- so the
     * work is done here instead, and what the map gets is the last build that finished.
     *
     * <p>That is a real and deliberate change in what these accessors mean: they offer the newest
     * finished reading rather than a reading built on the spot, so for as long as a build is running
     * they answer with the one before it. It is the same bargain {@link MtrWholeMap} already makes for
     * the whole network, and the honest one: a map that draws a railway one reading out of date is a
     * map, while a map that blocks the frame it is drawn in is a stutter.
     *
     * <p>Daemon, because nothing should be kept alive by a cache: the game asks the process to exit
     * while this is idle, and the harness exits without ever having asked it for anything.

     * The stations of a reading, as the places a journey can end at.
     *
     * <h2>Why MTR's stations are not already places</h2>
     * MTR makes a station out of every area the player draws, and an area is a box the player drags
     * over the platforms it covers. A station built the obvious way -- one platform at a time, one box
     * around each -- therefore reaches this mod as several stations that share a name, standing a few
     * blocks apart: the same station, said four times. Offered as they arrive, that is a destination
     * picker listing one station four times, four markers on the map where there is one building, and a
     * line calling at whichever of the four its platforms happen to be in -- so a change between two
     * lines that meet at that station looks like a change between two stations a hundred blocks apart,
     * and a journey through it is planned as two.
     *
     * <p>So stations that say they are the same station are one place here: the same name, ignoring
     * case and surrounding spaces, and boarding points within {@code mtr_station_merge_blocks} of each
     * other. The distance is what keeps two towns that both called their station "Central" apart, and
     * the name is what keeps two genuinely different stations of one complex apart. Stations with no
     * name are never merged -- every nameless station would be one place -- and the whole rule is off
     * when the configured distance is zero, which offers MTR's stations exactly as MTR has them.
     *
     * <p>Nothing is written back to MTR: this is how the reading is offered, not a change to it, and
     * MTR's own dashboard goes on showing its stations as it always did. A journey planned to a place
     * reaches whichever of its stations the ride runs to, because the place stands where its platforms
     * are.
