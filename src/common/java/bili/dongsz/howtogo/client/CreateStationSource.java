/**
 * Destinations from Create's train stations.
 *
 * <h2>Where the names come from</h2>
 * Create's own graph carries them: a station is an edge point on the graph, its name is a field on
 * {@code GlobalStation}, and Create's map integration labels stations with it. So when the layer read
 * Create's graph, a station is offered under the name the player gave it.
 *
 * <p>When the layer came from the block scan instead there is no name to be had: a station's name is
 * not in the world's blocks, only in Create's railway data. Those stations are named from where they
 * are, with the coordinates the picker's search can be used on, and the source note beside them says
 * where they came from.
 *
 * <p>The positions come from {@link RailTrackStore}, which is the only thing that knows what the
 * layer currently holds. No Create class is involved on this side, so with Create absent this source
 * reports itself unavailable and the picker shows only the sources that do have something.
