/**
 * The machine-read rails a view draws, as one sequence.
 *
 * <h2>Two layers, and who decides what is in them</h2>
 * Create's track graph and MTR's marks -- the track each line read out of MTR runs along, cut per line
 * and kept per line. Whether a line's part of the second layer is there at all is that line's own switch
 * in the editor (see {@link MtrMarks} and {@link MtrKnown}), so a line switched off contributes no road
 * and one switched on contributes the stretch it was planned along. The line's own stroke on the map is
 * planned over exactly those marks and painted after them, which is what makes the road the thing under
 * the line and the line the thing you read.
 *
 * <h2>Why one name</h2>
 * Every view that draws a machine-read rail used to name Create's layer itself, and each of them drifted
 * as the layers changed. Going through here is what makes "the views draw the same rails" a property of
 * the code rather than something each new view has to remember.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is a sequence and not a list</h2>
 * The callers draw one segment at a time and are called per frame, sometimes several times a frame;
 * building a merged list would copy both layers on every pass. Walking the two in turn costs one
 * iterator and nothing else, and neither layer can be double-counted because each is walked once.
