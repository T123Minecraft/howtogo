/**
 * One map element.
 *
 * <p>Normally this wraps a single road polyline, so a whole road is drawn in one call and the
 * per-element overhead is paid once per road rather than once per vertex.
 *
 * <p>There are also four singleton overlays. Xaero calls renderers in order and we are the only
 * renderer in our layer, so appending these last draws them on top of the roads without needing a
 * second renderer/reader pair:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #MARKS} - the track MTR's lines run along, drawn as the polylines the lines are drawn
 *       from rather than as one element per rail</li>
 *   <li>{@link #EDIT_UI} - node handles, snap indicator and rubber band, only while editing</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ROUTE} - the active navigation route, drawn whenever a destination is set</li>
 *   <li>{@link #LABELS} - road and place names, always, and last so text is never painted over</li>
 * </ul>
