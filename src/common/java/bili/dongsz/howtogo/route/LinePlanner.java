/**
 * Plans a journey over the player's lines: walk to a stop, ride, change lines where two lines meet,
 * ride again, walk to the destination.
 *
 * <h2>The graph</h2>
 * One node per stop position, and two kinds of edge between them:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ride</b> -- between stops that are neighbours <em>on a line</em>. This is what makes the
 *       order in a line mean something: a ride follows the line, so the journey can only get off
 *       where that line actually calls. Both directions are allowed, because a line is a service
 *       rather than a one-way street -- a player travelling back along it is riding it, not breaking
 *       it;</li>
 *   <li><b>transfer</b> -- between stops of <em>different</em> lines that stand within
 *       {@link #TRANSFER_RADIUS} blocks of each other. This is the leg the player asked to see: a
 *       change of lines is a short walk between where one line puts you down and where the next one
 *       picks you up, and it is a leg of the journey like any other. Two lines calling at the same
 *       block are the same node, so that change costs nothing and is not a leg at all.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>One search, and why it is one</h2>
 * This used to run twice: first with transfers forbidden, and if that found anything at all it was
 * returned without the second search ever running. The idea was that a direct ride should not be
 * passed over in favour of a longer journey that happens to change lines -- but the answer to that is
 * a price on changing lines, not a veto, and the veto did the opposite of what it intended: it made
 * the best <em>single-line</em> journey the answer whenever one existed, however far around it went,
 * even with a two-ride journey standing next to it that arrived in a third of the time. That is what
 * "the route goes the long way round" was. A transfer now costs the walk between the two platforms
 * plus {@link #TRANSFER_PENALTY_SECONDS}, both searches are one, and the search simply takes the
 * cheapest whole journey.
 *
 * <h2>Why the graph is built before the search</h2>
 * A link's cost is a real route planned by the road router, so it is the expensive part of planning.
 * Those plans used to be made lazily, from inside the search, under a budget -- and when the budget
 * ran out the neighbouring links were silently skipped, which changes the graph underneath a running
 * shortest-path search and leaves it answering a question about a network that never existed. The
 * links are now all planned first, so the search is a plain Dijkstra over a graph that does not move,
 * and the budget can only ever drop the tail of the ride list, once, out loud.
 *
 * <h2>Why the ends are the only walks that are searched</h2>
 * The first and last legs are walks between the player and a stop, and there are as many candidates
 * for those as there are stops. The {@link #WALK_CANDIDATES} nearest at each end are tried: a stop
 * that is not among them cannot be where a sensible journey starts or finishes, and trying every one
 * of them would plan a walk route per stop on every press. The number is well above the three it once
 * was, because three stops sorted by <em>straight-line</em> distance is not three good ways to start a
 * journey: the fourth nearest is often the only one on a line that goes anywhere.

     * <p><b>Why it is no longer 512.</b> A ride used to be an A* over every rail in the world at once,

     * a layer that served every line of its kind. A reading that names each line's rails changes what a
     * ride costs -- it is a search over <em>that line's own track</em> and nothing else, see
     * {@link RideRoads} -- and a whole railway read from a server is hundreds of lines and thousands of
     * stops, which is three and a half thousand rides rather than the hundreds a window holds. At 512
     * the graph was cut off after the first few lines and every journey across the network answered "no
     * journey", which is the failure this number was meant to be a guard against rather than the cause
     * of. The per-ride cost is what makes raising it safe, and the check in the regression harness is
     * what keeps that true: it plans over a hundred and sixty lines and asserts both that a journey
     * comes out and that the whole plan is quick.

     * Every way out of a stop, worked out when the search reaches it rather than before it starts.

     * It was, and the reason was sound while a plan ran over a handful of lines: the links are the
     * expensive part, planning them all first makes the search a plain Dijkstra over a graph that does
     * not move, and the budget that used to guard the planning could then only ever drop the tail of
     * the list rather than remove edges from a search already running.
     *
     * <p>What a reading of a whole railway changed is the arithmetic. The graph is every neighbouring
     * pair of stops of every line, in both directions, and it has nothing to do with the journey asked
     * for: a two-hundred-block trip across a network of three hundred lines plans twelve thousand rides,
     * every one of them a route the road router has to work out, and the player sees the map freeze
     * while it happens. Journey length not mattering was the symptom, and this is the cause.
     *
     * <p>Dijkstra does not need the whole graph. It needs the edges out of each stop at the moment it
     * settles that stop, because an edge is only ever relaxed from a settled node. So a stop's links are
     * planned when it is settled and kept for the one time they are asked for, and a short journey plans
     * the stops it actually reaches -- which is bounded by the cost of the answer rather than by the
     * size of the railway.
     *
     * <p>This is sound in a way the old lazy attempt was not: nothing here is capped per stop, so a
     * stop's links are always all of them, and the graph a running search sees never changes underneath
     * it. What is left of the budget is a budget on the whole plan, reported out loud if it is ever
     * reached, and reaching it now means a search that genuinely explored the network rather than one
     * that was asked a short question about it.

         * A transfer is a change of lines at one interchange, and an interchange is by definition two
         * stops within {@link #TRANSFER_RADIUS} of each other -- a platform and the stop beside it, not a
         * walk across town. Planning one is therefore asking the road router for a route it almost never
         * has an answer to: there are no roads inside a station, so the answer is absent or a detour, and
         * it is thrown away for the straight hop this builds anyway. What it cost to ask is the whole of
         * the world scanned, because the router finds its nearest road by walking every segment of the
         * network -- once for the start, once for the goal, and again on its fallback search. The legs
         * where following the roads does matter -- the walk from the player to the first stop and from the
         * last stop to the destination -- are still planned; see {@link #walk}.
         *
         * <h2>And why the near stops are found through a grid</h2>
         * A transfer is two stops within the radius, so the pairs that could be one are a neighbourhood
         * question, and asking it of every pair was the square of the network: invisible on the handful of
         * lines MTR's own client data can produce, and most of a second on the thousands a whole-network
         * reading brings. The grid is the same trick the road network's own spatial index uses, for the
         * same reason -- the pairs worth measuring are the pairs that are near each other, and finding
         * them should not cost the size of the world.
