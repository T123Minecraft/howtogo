/**
 * Which roads a plan runs on, when the answer depends on the line.
 *
 * <h2>The problem this solves</h2>
 * A network handed to the planner may have machine-read marks merged into it -- the rails a player did
 * not draw, read out of another mod. Whether a particular line should be planned over those marks is a
 * question about that line, and the planner cannot answer it: the rails belong to the world rather than
 * to the line, one layer serves every line of a kind, and the route package knows nothing about the mod
 * the marks came from.
 *
 * <p>Two networks and a predicate is therefore what the planner is given: the one with the marks, the
 * same without them, and which lines want them. A line that does not is planned on the network without,
 * so switching its marks off really does take them out of its own ride -- rather than merely declining
 * to add a layer that some other line has already added, which would be a switch that does nothing.
 *
 * <p>The pair are the same object when nothing wants the difference, so a plan over lines that all
 * agree never pays for a second copy of the world.
 *
 * <h2>And the line's own track, which is the third answer</h2>
 * The layer above is shared: every switched-on line of a kind rides the same rails, so a ride is planned
 * over all of them at once. That is the only answer there was while nothing said which rails belonged to
 * which line -- but a reading that names them does, and the mod keeps each line's own track for drawing
 * it (see {@code MtrTransit.trackOf}). Planning over that instead is the same ride and two things more:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>it is the line's own track</b>, so a ride cannot take a stretch of another line's railway
 *       because it happened to be shorter;</li>
 *   <li><b>it is affordable</b>. A ride is planned per pair of neighbouring stops, and a whole railway
 *       read from a server is hundreds of lines and thousands of stops. Searching a layer holding every
 *       line's track costs the size of that layer per plan; searching one line's own track costs the
 *       size of that line. This is the difference between planning a journey over a railway in a few
 *       milliseconds and in several seconds, which is what happened when the whole network first
 *       arrived and every ride was planned over all of it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Asked only of lines that want the marks: a line whose marks are switched off is planned on the
 * plain network, and its own track is part of the marks it has declined.
