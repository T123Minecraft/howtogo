/**
 * The front door of public transport routing: a journey over the player's lines, or nothing.
 *
 * <h2>There is no fallback, and that is the point</h2>
 * This used to fall back to a search over station <em>pairs</em> when the lines could not carry a
 * journey, and that fallback was worse than useless. It boarded at the nearest point of whatever
 * track happened to be closest -- a line nobody chose -- rode it as far as it went, and could not
 * reach the destination at all. From the player's side that is indistinguishable from the mod
 * ignoring the lines they built: "it sent me to the nearest station even though it cannot get
 * there", and the long way round that came with it.
 *
 * <p>Public transport here means the lines the player configured. If none of them can carry the
 * journey, the honest answer is that there is no public transport journey, and the walking comparison
 * upstream is free to offer the walk instead. A route that pretends to be public transport while
 * ignoring every line is not a worse answer, it is a wrong one.
 *
 * <h2>Where the routing lives</h2>
 * {@link LinePlanner}: the stops are the nodes of a directed weighted graph, the links between
 * neighbouring stops on a line are its edges, and Dijkstra over it is the search. This class only
 * finds the player's own stations, which the line editor offers as candidates.

     * is what the board-and-alight guidance needs -- so this is public, and the navigation plans the
