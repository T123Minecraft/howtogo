/**
 * A grid index over one {@link RoadNetwork}, for "what is nearest this point" questions.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * Snapping asked that question by walking every node and then every vertex of every segment, and so
 * did the editor's rail snap. Both run inside a frame, so the cost of pointing at the map grew with
 * the size of the map -- which is the one thing a player is certain to grow. The answer is not a
 * better search but an index: a uniform grid of buckets, so a query reads the few cells around the
 * point instead of the whole network.
 *
 * <h2>Exactness</h2>
 * This is an accelerator, not an approximation. {@link #nearestNode} and {@link #nearestOnSegment}
 * return what the exhaustive walk returned, down to the projected point and the vertex span the point
 * was found on, which is what makes it safe to put under behaviour a player has already learned. Two
 * things buy that:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the search widens by whole cells and stops only once the <em>nearest possible</em> point in
 *       the next ring is further away than the best candidate already found, so a nearer point can
 *       never be sitting in a ring that was skipped;</li>
 *   <li>the candidate test is the caller's own, including its tie-break, so a point read from the
 *       index is the point the scan would have picked rather than merely an equally near one.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What the caller supplies</h2>
 * Radii here are in world blocks, but a caller's idea of "near enough" is usually a budget of screen
 * pixels: a road editor wants a catch radius that feels the same at every zoom, and a fixed world
 * radius is unusable zoomed in and useless zoomed out. The conversion belongs to the caller, which is
 * the only side that knows the viewport -- so it passes a world radius in, and {@link Coverage} lets
 * it state the test that radius came from. Keeping that test with the caller is what lets the two
 * axes differ without this class having to know why they would.
