/**
 * A highway never asks a driver to bend more than a hundred degrees.
 *
 * <h2>The rule</h2>
 * A highway is a road built to be driven along and it has no way to turn round on it -- the mod's own
 * guidance says so, where a highway U-turn is re-worded as carrying on to the next junction. That was
 * wording on top of routes that had already been allowed to plan the hairpin, so a player could be
 * sent up a highway and told to double back on it. This holds the rule itself: no planned route bends
 * more than {@code HIGHWAY_BEND_LIMIT_DEGREES} where a highway is involved, and the bend the driver
 * would actually have to make is read back off the route's own polyline rather than trusted to the
 * search.
 *
 * <h2>What must not change</h2>
 * A hundred degrees is not "no turning on a highway": a right-angled junction is ninety and stays, a
 * dual carriageway's turn at the end of its median stays, and a ramp curving away stays. Roads that
 * are not highways may bend as sharply as they like -- a driver turning into a side street and a
 * walker cutting back along a path are both ordinary -- so the checks below pin that too.
 *
 * <h2>How each network is built</h2>
 * Every doubling-back case is a <em>dogleg</em>: a long straight piece, one step across, and a long
 * piece back. The step is short and the pieces either side are long, so the doubling back is the only
 * shape the case is about, and the endpoints are put at the far ends so that neither is close enough
 * to the other for an off-road shortcut to answer instead.
