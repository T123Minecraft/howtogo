/**
 * Checks which network a plan runs a line on.
 *
 * <p>In the {@code route} package because {@link RideRoads#forWalks} is package-private: which roads a
 * walking leg is offered is a decision the planner makes, so that half of the seam is internal to the
 * package and cannot be reached from outside it. ({@link RideRoads#forLine} is public, because the line
 * editor has to ask the planner's own question about a ride rather than work out its own answer.) It
 * lives with the harness and is compiled the same way; nothing in the mod calls it.
 *
 * <p>The property being pinned down is the one that makes a per-line switch real rather than decorative:
 * a line whose marks are off is handed a network that never had them, not the marked network with a
 * filter in front of it. The difference matters because MTR's marks are one shared layer -- every line
 * rides the same rails -- so "do not add the marks for this line" is not something the planner can act
 * on.
