/**
 * Checks what the station announcements are built from.
 *
 * <p>A public transport journey is planned as legs and then flattened into one {@link Route}, which is
 * what the map draws and what the navigation measures along. The flattening is lossy by design -- a
 * route carries one mode and cannot say where the riding begins -- so what the rider has to be told has
 * to survive on the journey itself: {@link Trip#rides()}, where each ride names its line, the end of the
 * line it is travelling towards, and every stop it calls at with its distance along the whole journey.
 *
 * <p>Everything the announcements do is arithmetic on that: which ride is in force at a distance, which
 * stop has just been reached, how many stops are left before the one being got off at, and whether the
 * next stop is that one. An off-by-one-stop mistake here is invisible until it is heard at the wrong
 * platform -- "one stop to go" while two stations out -- which is why the numbers are held rather than
 * the sentences.
