# Launches the mod in a real client and gets it ready to be tested from a player's side.
#
# The routing harness (tools/routing-harness) covers the pure logic in seconds with no game. This is the
# other half: a real client, the real world, the mod's own screens and guidance. Two ways to use it:
#
#   -Auto      the client opens a world by itself, runs the in-game self-test, writes the report to the
#              log, and quits. One command, no typing, a pass/fail at the end -- which is the whole of
#              what a build check needs. See SelfTest and AutoSelfTest in the mod.
#   (default)  the client opens and stays up for the parts only a player can drive: the checklist in
#              README.md, and /howtogo selftest typed by hand in whatever world is loaded.
#
# Usage:
#   .\tools\user-test\run-user-test.ps1                     # start the client, wait until the mod is up
#   .\tools\user-test\run-user-test.ps1 -Auto               # open TEST, self-test, report, quit
#   .\tools\user-test\run-user-test.ps1 -Auto -World MyWorld
#   .\tools\user-test\run-user-test.ps1 -Stop               # stop client(s) started from this project
#   .\tools\user-test\run-user-test.ps1 -ResetData          # back up and clear the mod's own data files
#
# Exit: 0 when the client is up, or when -Auto's report has no failures, or when the requested action
# succeeded; 1 otherwise.
